# Dropshot Lure Depth Calculator 

A simple calculator that calculates the distance of the lure on a dropshot from the bottom given the length of the leader (and other inputs).

This calculator was inspired from https://www.koaw.org/dropshotsim. However, the inputs are slightly different. The casting distance in this calculator is the horizontal distance from the angler to where the lure lands in the water (and presumably falls straight down the water column) instead of the horizontal distance between the rod tip and where the line enters the water. This is more intuitive to me as anglers typically cast at targets x feet away.
